# Split_ImageDatasets
I wrote a python function to split the image datasets for image classify which organized by folders which indicate the class
Firstly, create a folder named as 'data', and create three folders named as 'train', 'test', 'val' respectively in the 'data' folder. Then choose the ratio of test set, and validation set.

# Remember!!!
If there are any hidden files on the dataset dirent, the program will fail. Please delete other files(such as dirent like .ipynb ...) in advance.
